# nueral_net_xor

The program is the implementation of the nueral net xor function. XOr, or Exclusive Or, is a binary logical operator that takes in Boolean inputs and gives out True if and only if the 
two inputs are different. This logical operator is especially useful when we want to check two conditions that can't be simultaneously true. Perceptron is not enough to make the 
prediction as the values are not linearly sepearable so we have made use of multi layered perceptron.

The program takes two values as the input and gives xor value of them with help of weights calculated earlier and the sigmoid activation function.the language used is c++.There 3 files 
out of which one contains the code of the program the other two text files are the input give to the program and the output obtained from the program.

The function used for the detection of errors is sum of squared errors and the activation function is sigmoid.The wieghts are adjusted if the error rate cross the threshold value.The xor 
is calculated based on a XOr b = (a AND NOT b) OR (bAND NOTa).
